# Devitrak-App Admin Dashboard


Welcome to the Devitrack-App Admin Dashboard! This is a Progressive Web App (PWA) built with React that allows admins to manage clients and their associated data, as well as perform various actions such as creating new clients, assigning receivers to clients, verifying payment transactions per client, collecting credit card information and generating payment tokens for deposits, and creating, editing, and deleting admin users based on permission.

The app uses various dependencies, including axios for making API requests, moment for formatting dates, react-bootstrap for UI components, react-modal for displaying modal windows, recharts for data visualization, and web-vitals for measuring web performance.
